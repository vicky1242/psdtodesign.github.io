                                <p class="my-4 ">Handshake is a FAST growing multi-million-dollar tech company focused on improving equity in career opportunities for students.  When we first met, they needed a from-scratch rebuild of their marketing site for an imminent
                                    rebranding announcement–and they needed it fast.  </p>
                                <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">Love at first site</h2>
                                <p class="my-4 ">This project required a skilled developer–but also a strategic thinker.  They needed a project managerial mind who could take ownership of the situation, manage laterally, self-unblock, and navigate the diverse needs of
                                    multiple stakeholders across four departments.  In short, they needed someone who could tame the beautiful, dynamic chaos of a fast growing startup into a successful launch–on a deadline.  I came recommended as a pinch
                                    hitter who could wear all the hats needed to get the job done.</p>
                                <p class="my-4 ">Despite a harrowing timeline, our first launches saw double digit improvements in conversions.  It was so successful that I stayed at Handshake as a contractor for two years, co-owning the development of joinhandshake.com
                                    on a two-person dev team.</p>
                                <p class="my-4 ">While I ultimately decided to part ways and more deeply pursue creative tech freelancing, this experience taught me how to go above and beyond serving a fast-paced, complex corporate team at scale.</p>
                                <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">All the hats</h2>
                                <p class="my-4 ">Working with several teams of designers and strategists, I built dozens of pages &amp; microsites, shepherded rebrands (full and partial), and even coached some design contractors new to web design on best practices.  When
                                    I saw the business needs were changing, I proposed and spearheaded a site-wide full stack tech migration to reduce costs, increase development speed, and create a better experience for content managers. I helped build
                                    Algolia search experiences, Marketo integrations, animated data visualizations, and even a user-facing interactive image editor. </p>

                                <p class="my-4 ">As a larger marketing dev team began to form toward the end of my tenure, new dev leadership trusted me with senior tasks. I owned our tooling/ops, conducted technical intervews, delegated and reviewed junior contributions,
                                    coached our team on new tech &amp; best practices, built in-house libraries, and even added an e2e/visual regression testing workflow by my own initiative to help the team manage a rapidly scaling marketing site.</p>

                                <p class="my-4 ">Handshake needed to get the attention of the nation’s top student-facing recruiters with an eye-catching experience. The “Next Is Now” promotional campaign would show how far the recruiting field had come by 2021–and position
                                    Handshake as the nextgen tool of choice.  Lead designer Stephanie Jung had the awesome idea to build an old-school 90’s desktop that would transform into a modern system in front of the recruiter’s eyes, reinforcing
                                    themes of transformation and old-to-new.</p>
                                <p class="my-4 ">I was looped in because the team was investing heavily and this experience <em>had</em> to be sick.  Many prototypes and some fun with glitch animations later, the launch knocked it out of the park!  Handshake saw a huge
                                    return on its investment–growing its clientbase and reputation.</p>
                                <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">Game of Life</h2>
                                <p class="my-4 ">The microsite features a unique animation as the background transforms from dithered gray to blue-green gradient.  In my prototyping, I was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life" class="underline decoration-1 underline-offset-4 hover:text-projectColor"
                                    target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">John Conway’s “Game of Life.”</a>  I divided the screen into a large matrix of square pixels.  On page load, each GUI item on the page “competes” to grab territory–claiming as
                                    many adjacent squares as it can until the page is fully divided up.  When an item is triggered to transform, a random tile beneath it is deleted.  Each animation frame, the neighbors of a deleted tile will delete themselves
                                    according to a carefully tuned set of rules–repeating until all of the tiles in the item’s territory are deleted.  The result is rendered in real time in WebGL via PIXI.js.  With a little randomness and a differently-sized
                                    matrix depending on the screen size, the animation is never the same twice!</p>
                                <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">CSS glitch transitions</h2>
                                <p class="my-4 ">Each GUI item on the desktop is styled twice–with two different sets of CSS styling code. One for old, one for new.  CSS is really good at tweening between different styles!  While we usually choose gradual, smooth transitions
                                    to tween, you can also specify bouncy <a href="https://cubic-bezier.com/#0,1.65,1,-0.6" class="underline decoration-1 underline-offset-4 hover:text-projectColor" target="_blank" rel="noindex nofollow">zigzag cubic bezier functions</a>.
                                    A function like this will slingshot the styles to an overexaggerated place and back before finally arriving!  Combine this zigzagging tween function with a different randomized delay and duration for every single styling
                                    property, and you get this fun glitch effect!</p>

                                    my jam and I’d love the challenge.  (They were right. I wouldn’t allow them to walk back their idea.)  Simultaneously, with a target audience of font all-stars and enthusiasts, they knew they could trust me to execute
                                    the page’s typography and layout perfectly.</p>
                                <p class="my-4 ">The launch was a hit–propelling the event’s buzz and yet again solidifying Typeforce’s place in the world of off-the-wall typography. The exhibition was packed with both people and world class art–and I was humbled to hear
                                    there was buzz in the crowd about this crazy announcement page.</p>

                                <p class="my-4 ">After trying many different solutions and tech stacks, we finally found a winning recipe. We used a physics engine (matter.js) to simulate springs anchored along the borders of each glyph.  The springs would wiggle freely
                                    as the user interacted and then we would feed their wiggling coordinates into a 3D renderer (three.js). There, those points were used to redraw the glyphs each frame in WebGL–at a smooth 60fps.  Turns out, a series
                                    of wiggling springs is a good approximation for the surface of our jiggling blob.  While I wrote this code independently with different tools, I learned this clever spring technique directly from <a href="https://tympanus.net/codrops/2021/04/12/wobbly-2d-physics-with-matter-js-and-paper-js/"

                                    2. Attempt to capture the essence in a prototype. 3. Have really fun conversations where the designer layers on new ideas, reactions, and feedback. 4. Repeat (a lot) until fully baked. </p>
                                <p class="my-4 ">Back and forth.  Ping, pong.  We spent a LONG time ping-ponging to get the 12 <em>just</em> right–and I regret nothing.</p>

                                <p class="my-4 ">Sometimes a design vision is open–inviting creative collaboration and exploration. Other times, the designer has already architected it down to the last detail in their mind’s eye –simply waiting for a skilled craftsperson
                                    to build it with precision.  I love the challenge and growth provided by both ends of the spectrum.  In this case, Tom had his world masterfully premeditated–from the geometry, to the reflection imagery, to even the
                                    camera’s field of view.  It was exhilarating to try to keep up with him!  Nudging angles. Adjusting animation speeds by percentage points.  Every detail matters because, as I’ve observed working the high-calibur design
                                    thinkers, a tiny adjustment can have a massive impact!  When I reflect on this project, I’m most proud of how a compelling and <em>tasteful</em> 3D experience emerged from our meticulous attention to detail and care
                                    for Tom’s original vision.</p>

                            <p class="my-4 ">The University of Illinois had a crisis.  With the pandemic canceling their physical exhibition, they needed a digital experience to showcase their students’ art. For a design program with a reputation to maintain, an ordinary
                                cookie-cutter gallery site wasn’t gonna cut it.  This needed to impress.  Enter JP Ramirez, a program alum and veteran brand designer.  JP found me in the search for serious dev muscle to precisely execute and technologically
                                empower his vision.</p>
                            <p class="my-4 ">We launched to resounding critical praise–delivering an award-winning site, helping U of I make a statement in a troubled time, boosting program morale, and doubling as an evergreen showcase that, to this day, still promotes
                                the program and attracts new students.</p>

                            <p class="my-4 ">JP envisioned a homepage with a dynamic, randomized pattern of student art and his custom typography glyphs strewn about the brand&#x27;s grid system. We had a blast collaborating over many prototypes to find just the right
                                version technically and aesthetically (creatively leveraging CSS Grid and GreenSock).</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">An animator&#x27;s dream workflow</h2>
                            <p class="my-4 ">We wanted to showcase interactive vector animations for every glyph in JP’s typeface. With 26 characters, each with multiple animation states, motion designer Andrew Reaume was on the hook for 100 high quality animations. All
                                on a timeline!  So, we created a workflow leveraging the Lottie.js vector animation framework. Andrew could build his animations in After Effects and export them directly into my code where they would be rendered as performant
                                vector animations (with their different in, out, hover, etc. animation states triggered appropriately). This allowed him to move quickly and guaranteed perfect execution. Frequently staged previews let him see how his work
                                looked on the actual site at every stage of his process. He could iterate as much needed to get things just right–with almost no additional dev costs.</p>
                            <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">Content, content, content </h2>
                            <p class="my-4 ">To date, thousands of art entries have been cataloged across the exhibition sites we created.  That scale of content entry via CMS is a substantial labor–often by stakeholders who should be focusing on more critical business
                                tasks.  So, we implemented a time-saving automation pipeline to batch add hundreds of entries at a time into the CMS–by importing a google docs spreadsheet.</p>

                                    <p class="my-4 ">The first student exhibition since the start of the pandemic! IIT College of Architecture needed an impressive digital gallery experience to celebrate this moment. They wanted high-concept, magazine elegance executed
                                        with architectural precision. They <em>also</em> loved their backend content management system from previous years and wanted to keep the existing codebase. I was recommended as a dev who could deliver on their
                                        vision all while adapting to their existing tech–on a timeline.</p>
                                    <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">The blueprint</h2>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">Jeffrey Wigen and Elandri Steyn envisioned a homepage experience that payed abstract-but-tangible homage to Crown Hall, the beloved modernist building housing their college. Images of student artwork would load dynamically
                                        into geometries evocative of Crown Hall&#x27;s rectangular windows–serving as a metaphor for the physical exhibition.</p>
                                    <figure class="border-[1px] border-[currentColor]"><img src="../cdn.sanity.io/images/0ttnaq4a/production/c8b44486a32367772252cd727f70f2f592f796d3-1280x1003001f.png?w=1000" alt="A black and white image of IIT&#x27;s Crown Hall–a symmetrical single-story facade known for the geometry of its rectangular windows."
                                        /></figure>
                                    <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">Wrestling browsers</h2>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">Due to an obscure bug in Safari&#x27;s line rendering, we had to think outside the box to get our particular line animations looking great on <em>all</em> supported browsers. We tried many techniques, but ultimately
                                        discovered we got the best look by animating moving white lines ON TOP of a fully drawn black shape.</p>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">So we&#x27;re actually animating the negative space, rather than the lines themselves! And this made things a great deal more difficult to implement–but, for better and worse, I am a stubborn perfectionist and will
                                        go to great lengths to avoid compromising a designer&#x27;s vision. (ESPECIALLY if it&#x27;s a cool vision. lol.)</p>
                                    <h2 class="mt-16 font-mono text-2xl">Animating &quot;perimeters&quot;</h2>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">&quot;Sometimes it’s at the edges that we do our best work,&quot; reads Jeffrey and Elandri&#x27;s statement. Thematically, the exhibition &quot;Perimeters&quot; explored the heightened awareness of boundaries that
                                        characterized the pandemic. It would embody the artistic resilience shown by their students while drawing visual analogy to the linework of architectural design schematics. </p>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">It&#x27;s creatively really fun to have a strong conceptual motivation for animation work!</p>
                                    <p class="my-4 ">The line segments that circle Crown Hall on the homepage are precisely sized to be evocative of the building shape when they first appear. In the next moment, they begin to rotate–and ultimately close during page transitions.
                                        On gallery pages, more playful linework cathartically dissolves as the user moves their mouse, encouraging exploration of student artwork. </p>
